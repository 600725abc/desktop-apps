Build an interactive Windows XP-style desktop simulation using only a single HTML file that includes embedded CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. The desktop must feature three functional application icons:



Paint App

On click, opens a draggable, resizable window.

Contains an interactive HTML5 <canvas> element for freehand drawing using the mouse.

Include tools: color picker, brush size selector, and a clear button.

Video Player App

On click, opens a draggable, resizable window.

Contains an input field for entering a YouTube video URL and a play button.

Embeds and plays the YouTube video using an iframe or YouTube embed API.

Calculator App

On click, opens a draggable, resizable window.

Contains a functional calculator interface with buttons for digits (0–9), decimal point, basic operations (+, −, ×, ÷), equals, and clear.

Calculator must update a display field in real time and support keyboard input.

Additional Requirements:



All apps and desktop UI elements must be visually styled to mimic Windows XP, including icons, taskbar, window chrome, and fonts.

All interactivity must be implemented using vanilla JavaScript (no external libraries).

Do not return static or rendered images—output must consist of fully interactive front-end code only, embedded in one HTML file.

Use absolute or fixed positioning to manage window layout and dragging.

Ensure apps can be opened, minimized, and closed.

Maintain modular code structure inside <script> and <style> blocks to enhance readability.
